# Learning Path

An open source path for anyone getting into various paths of Tech

This repository is developed to help people learn about the basics of programming and computer science. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.

We would be sharing the basic guides, links to free and premium course. These courses would be recommended by the community and the team. We would also be sharing the resources that we use to learn and grow.
